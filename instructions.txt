      General Gameplay Requirements

        - Users must be able to choose from three difficulties: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
            Easy - 9x9 grid, 10 mines.
            Medium - 16x16 grid, 40 mines.
            Hard - 30x16 grid, 99 mines.
            
        - Adjacent is defined by the 8 tiles surrounding the target tile, on the diagonal, horizontal, and vertical planes. 

        - A left click must reveal a tile, if not flagged.
        - A right click must flag a tile or unflag a tile if already flagged.
        - A middle click must reveal all hidden, unflagged, and adjacent tiles
            This only works if: 
                1. The tile clicked on is revealed.
                2. The tile clicked on has a number on it. 
                3. The number of adjacent flags matches the number on the tile clicked on.

        - A tile will not be revealed by any means (middle click or left click) if the tile is flagged.
            
        - A revealed tile will display a number indicating how many mines it is adjacent to. CSS classes and images are provided for this.
        
        - If a tile is revealed and is not adjacent to any mines, it will reveal all adjacent tiles. This includes adjacent tiles with numbers on them.
            
        - The first tile clicked must not be a mine, nor adjacent to a mine. In other words it will have no number to display.

        - A timer will keep track of the how long the user has been playing. It begins ticking once the first tile is revealed.
            This is essentially the player score.

        - A counter will show how many mines are left, relative to the number of flags planted.
            This is calculated by: mines_left = (total_mines - flags_planted)
            It is not a 'true' measure of mines left.
            
        - When a player is actively playing and the mouse is down: the smiley will be in limbo (face_limbo).

        End Game Conditions
        - When all of the non-mine tiles are revealed the game is over. A player does not need to flag all of the mines to win.
            You must display the user's completion time as well as congratulate them on their victory.
            The smiley will wear sunglasses when the player wins.
        - When a player reveals a mine, the game is over.
            You must inform the player they have lost.
            The smiley will play dead when the player loses.
